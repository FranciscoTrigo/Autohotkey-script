# YamiFrankc's AHK script

This is my script for AHK, with things and snipets that I like.
Part of it is all made by me, some other may be taken from somewhere.

I use this in both my desktop, where I use an Ergodox keyboard, and on my laptop, which is a Thinkpad Carbon X1.

For now, the most important thing is that I removed Caps Lock, that key is mostly useless!
